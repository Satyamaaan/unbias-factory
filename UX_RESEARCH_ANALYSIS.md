## 1. Current Flow Analysis

### 1.1 Flow Structure Overview

The onboarding consists of 6 sequential steps managed by the `BorrowerContext` with data persistence:

| Step | Title | Complexity | Data Collected |
|------|-------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Property Step | Medium | Property type, value, city, pincode |
| 2 | Loan Step | Low | Loan amount, LTV calculation |
| 3 | Personal Step | Low | Full name, date of birth |
| 4 | Employment Step | **High** | Employment type, income, existing EMI, co-applicant |
| 5 | Contact Step | Medium | Mobile number, application summary |
| 6 | OTP Step | Medium | SMS verification, draft finalization |

### 1.2 Technical Architecture
- **State Management**: `BorrowerContext` with localStorage persistence
- **UI Framework**: Consistent `WizardLayout` with left sidebar progress
- **Navigation**: Linear progression with back/next buttons
- **Data Flow**: Draft → Verification → Final submission to `borrowers` table

## 2. Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis

### 2.1 Step 1: Property Step

**What it asks for:**
- Property type (4 options: Apartment, Independent House, Villa, Plot)
- Property value estimation (₹ amount)
- City (dropdown with 13 pre-defined cities)
- Pincode (optional, 6-digit validation)

**UX Strengths:**
✅ Clear visual property type selection with cards
✅ Helpful tooltip about pincode benefits
✅ Real-time currency formatting

**UX Issues:**
❌ Limited city options (only 13 cities) - major limitation for nationwide service
❌ No property value guidance or estimation tools
❌ Pincode is optional but could be valuable for better matching

### 2.2 Step 2: Loan Step

**What it asks for:**
- Loan amount required (minimum ₹1,00,000)
- Real-time LTV ratio calculation and validation

**UX Strengths:**
✅ Clear LTV feedback with visual indicators
✅ Automatic calculation and validation
✅ Helpful error messages for LTV limits

**UX Issues:**
❌ **CRITICAL**: Very minimal form with only one field
❌ No tenure selection (hardcoded to 20 years in offers)
❌ No loan purpose selection
❌ Missing loan type options (construction, ready property, etc.)

### 2.3 Step 3: Personal Step

**What it asks for:**
- Full name (minimum 2 characters)
- Date of birth with age validation (18-70 years)

**UX Strengths:**
✅ Real-time age calculation and eligibility feedback
✅ Clear visual feedback for age eligibility
✅ Proper date validation

**UX Issues:**
❌ Missing gender selection (required by many lenders)
❌ No PAN card input (essential for loan processing)
❌ No marital status (affects loan eligibility)

### 2.4 Step 4: Employment Step

**What it asks for:**
- Employment type (3 options: Salaried, Self-employed Professional, Self-employed Business)
- Income details (varies by employment type)
- Existing EMI amount
- Co-applicant yes/no

**UX Strengths:**
✅ Dynamic form based on employment type
✅ Clear income validation with helpful text
✅ Visual card-based selection for employment type

**UX Issues:**
❌ **CRITICAL**: No company details for salaried employees
❌ Missing work experience validation
❌ No co-applicant details collection (if yes selected)
❌ Complex form with many fields could cause abandonment

### 2.5 Step 5: Contact Step

**What it asks for:**
- Mobile number with country code
- Triggers OTP sending
- Shows complete application summary

**UX Strengths:**
✅ Comprehensive application summary before verification
✅ Clear mobile number validation
✅ Multiple country code support

**UX Issues:**
❌ No email address collection
❌ Summary might be overwhelming (could be shortened)
❌ Development mode shows test OTP (security concern)

### 2.6 Step 6: OTP Step

**What it asks for:**
- 6-digit OTP verification
- Finalizes draft and redirects to offers

**UX Strengths:**
✅ Clear OTP input with automatic formatting
✅ Resend functionality with countdown
✅ Rate limiting protection

**UX Issues:**
❌ No alternative verification methods
❌ Long finalization process could timeout
❌ Error handling could be more user-friendly

## 3. Critical UX Friction Points

### 3.1 Form Length and Complexity
- **Issue**: Step 4 (Employment) is particularly heavy with many conditional fields
- **Impact**: High abandonment risk at 67% progress
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Split into multiple sub-steps or use progressive disclosure

### 3.2 Missing Essential Information
- **Issue**: No PAN card, gender, company details collection
- **Impact**: Incomplete loan applications requiring manual follow-up
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Add these fields early in the flow

### 3.3 Limited Geographic Coverage
- **Issue**: Only 13 cities supported
- **Impact**: Excludes significant user base
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Add city search with type-ahead or state-based selection

### 3.4 No Loan Customization
- **Issue**: No tenure selection, loan purpose, or property readiness options
- **Impact**: Generic offers that may not match user needs
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Add loan preference step

## 4. Cognitive Load Issues

### 4.1 Information Overload
- Contact step summary shows all collected data
- Employment step has too many fields visible simultaneously
- Property value requires estimation without guidance

### 4.2 Navigation Confusion
- Users cannot skip or modify previous steps easily
- No clear indication of total time required
- Progress indicator shows steps but not percentage completion

### 4.3 Validation Timing
- Some validations only occur on "Next" click
- Real-time validation inconsistent across steps
- Error messages appear after user action, not during input
